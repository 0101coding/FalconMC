## Description
FalconMC is an afk Minecraft server written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) that aims to support all client versions ranging from 1.13 till 1.17.1 (1.8-12.2 coming eventually). Its main priority is performance and the ability to effortlessly hold many players at once. Support for writing custom plugins is planned.
